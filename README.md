# Basic_convolution_NN
This is done using the same fashion_mnist dataset but this time, the concept of convolutions and pooling is applied. 
This takes a bit more time while training  the neural network and it's efficiency mainly depends upon the activation fucntion and the optimizers used. When used properly, gives a significantly low "loss".
